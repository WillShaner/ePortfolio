    <h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>
    <p>As technology continues to advance, it has become increasingly important for people to have a basic understanding of web development. A frontend web development project that could help achieve this goal is a web page that shows the basics of frontend web development and how the different parts create a web page.</p>
<p>The online learning site would be a website designed to showcase the basics of front-end web development and provide knowledge in a user-friendly manner. The front end would be built using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on user experience and visual design. The site would feature an intuitive navigation system that allows visitors to browse the frontend learning site easily.</p>
<p>The website's visual design would be crucial in providing the knowledge in an organized and easily used manner. The homepage would include an example website and then potentially explain how the site was created. The other pages would include the 3 different sections of frontend web development and also provide information on how they work and also how they work to create a basic web page.</p>
<p>The educational site would provide several benefits to people, including increased knowledge and potentially spark an interest in web development. By creating an online educational site accessible to anyone with an internet connection, people can easily get a basic understanding of front-end web development. Graphic design and front-end web development allow for creative expression in the way that the creator can create different web pages and solve different problems. </p>
<p>
  This project incorporates the many education courses I have taken up to this point. These courses would include Educational Technology and Childhood development. This project would also include the computer science courses I have taken as well.
  In conclusion, a frontend web development project that teaches the basics of frontend web development would provide an easily accessible way to get a basic grasp of web development. Ultimately, this project has the potential to teach a user how they can create art themselves in the form of frontend web development.
