          My name is William Shaner and I am a senior at Henderson State University working towards my Bachelor of Integrated Studies. I completed my Associate of General Studies at the University of Arkansas Rich Mountain. After graduating I transferred to Henderson State University where I initially pursued Pre-Physical Therapy but switched to Social Studies Education. I have taken a wide variety of courses and plan to use this knowledge in my future profession. After some evaluation, I decided that my current major did not align with future goals and I considered not finishing college. After discovering the Bachelor of Integrated Studies at Henderson I will be able to graduate and also have the possibility of further education. My main goal once I obtain my degree is to pursue software engineering full time which I have been learning during my last year of college.
